I’m Joe, I build and operate production web systems.

I've spent the last several years shipping user-facing features that integrate multiple external systems including e-commerce platforms, third-party APIs and data pipelines. I'm particularly interested in how application architecture and data flow choices affect reliability and performance over time.

I'm currently open to full-time software engineering roles focused on frontend, full stack, or backend-leaning work. If you’re working on systems that value reliable and maintainable software, I’d love to connect.

## Books I’m reading
- TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 1
- Chip War
